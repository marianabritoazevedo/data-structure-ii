## Question 4

Create a simulated scenario, where you want to take a trip with the following route:

*   City 1 (North) to city 2 (South)
*   City 2 (South) to city 3 (Northeast)
*   City 3 (Northeast) to city 4 (Central-West)
*   City 4 (Central-West) to city 5 (Southeast)

#### Solution

To create this simulated scenario, five cities were chosen, one from each region of Brazil, and they were related to their respective airports through the creation of a dictionary. Below are the cities and airports chosen for each Brazilian region:

Region       | Airport | City
:--------:   | :------:| :--------:
North        | SNNG    | Novo Progresso
Northeast    | SBIL    | Ilhéus
South        | SSCN    | Canela
Southeast    | SBRP    | Ribeirão Preto
Central-West | SBAN    | Anápolis
