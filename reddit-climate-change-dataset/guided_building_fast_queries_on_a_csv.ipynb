I talked to a supposed \"AnCom\" who was oh so concerned about climate change and so sure that capitalism was ruining the planet and making people poor up until it came around to him giving up various comforts. No, you see, those are necessities to the communist! Fucking everything that they want is a necessity because it\\'s theirs. Your shit on the other hand should be theirs.\\n\\nOnce again, their ideology is no more than \"GIBS ME DAT!\" The lowest of low IQ ideologies out there.', 'Just a quick question. Why deny climate change when the evidence for a global rise in temperature, melting ice caps, rising ocean levels and other such things is so prominent? I mean the data is literally right in front of you, yet you deny it. Why?', \"Why not climate change? Isn't that more urgent than we expected?\", 'the US can, sure. Maybe some of Europe. but what about Canada, Australia, Japan? Or the rapidly developing countries which will soon eclipse the states in power needs? India, China, South America, Africa?\\n\\ncan they all switch in 5 to 7 years. absolutely not. no chance. itll be 50+ years and guess what, climate change is a global problem, not a US problem. ignore current output levels: think about future greenhouse gas emissions.\\n\\n', \"no, the research done in america is just some of the most advanced in the world at the moment. America itself is not doing very well in the combating of climate change itself though. compared to other countries such as Finland, Germany, The Netherlands and countless others are actually investing into using those technologies. Its great that america is doing the research but if they dont use it or invest into making it plausible its useless and wont stay there long. Even China is investing billions into renewable while america is one of the only countries in the world that is decreasing their investments. You were leading because of Obama and others. Funny how you're arguing against someone with something they helped establish.\", '[Explain this then, know-it-all. How is this not more important than what climate change is \"costing\"? As if the fucking money even matters](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/science/great-barrier-reef-coral-climate-change-dieoff.html?_r=0) ', \"I never understood the population control point of view. Human beings are literally the only thing that matters. Climate change is a big deal because it threatens us. \\n\\nPeople aren't the most important resource, they are the *only* resource. \\n\\nWhat are the chances of another Einstein being born? Someone who will single handedly expand our understanding of the universe? 1 in a billion? Less? \\n\\nHumanity needs more people on the extreme right side of the bell curve, not less. \", \"That's an interesting theory. They ran an experiment, subjected an experimental group to famine, a control group to no famine, and always found that ISIS started shit with the experimental group?\\n\\nI suppose that's what's so special about climatology... no one ever needs to prove anything. One more trailer park than usual tornadoed in Alabama? Must be climate change.\", '&gt; There is no null hypothesis with regard to one\\'s belief on the question of god\\'s existence, which is what the theism/atheism debate is mainly concerned with.\\n\\nThere is a default position on absolutely everything. That position is: I don\\'t believe in anything you say but I don\\'t know for sure. The other options are:\\n\\n* to believe anything someone says, which is being gullible and is not how you get knowledge, or\\n* to know something for sure when you don\\'t know anything about it, which is just lying\\n\\nSo, agnostic atheism - not believing in Gods but not knowing - is the default.\\n\\n&gt; there are some gods of which you\\'ve never heard\\n\\nNote: I never heard of any Gods growing up, so I didn\\'t know about - and didn\\'t believe in - any Gods. It was only much later that I was introduced to Gods and religions and I didn\\'t believe their claims.\\n\\n&gt; Your atheism falls on a spectrum ...\\n\\nI think this is fair to say. Is there a problem with this view?\\n\\n&gt; I think most people are concerned with creator gods\\n\\nWell in the US or this sub perhaps. I\\'m a lot more interested in the Greek Gods myself but I get your point :]\\n\\n&gt; observation can never demonstrate that god, in general, does not exist\\n\\nSure though it\\'s awfully inconvenient - we used to be able to see him and he seems to be MIA for a while now.\\n\\n&gt; you also have a belief that unicorns don\\'t exist. Am I wrong?\\n\\nYou are. I have no proof that unicorns don\\'t exist. It\\'s possible that the actual animal (rather than its magical properties) did actually exist at one point. If you mean that I have a belief that the magical unicorns don\\'t exist then I would simply say generally that magic doesn\\'t exist and therefore magical unicorns, being a subset of magic, don\\'t exist. The animal itself - as far as the horn - could.\\n\\n&gt; Well that\\'s not entirely true. \\n\\nYes it is. If you\\'re into Judaism or Christianity, God definitely used to appear and talk to you. Some people claim he still does. So, in the context of my typical debates with Christians, this behavior is expected.\\n\\n&gt; It\\'s possible that appearing to us would sully our free will \\n\\nAgain, if the context is the Abrahamic God then this isn\\'t an issue. For other Gods, perhaps. Here\\'s the thing though: a God that doesn\\'t make themselves known is no different from one that doesn\\'t exist.\\n\\n&gt; \"omnipotence,\" as a very specific philosophical term, has lately and often been hijacked by both bible-thumping idiots, as well as atheists constructing strawmen\\n\\nSpeaking for me personally, I go off of what theists describe. I wouldn\\'t call them \"bible-thumping idiots\" though. They\\'re the ones making the claims and I respond to those claims.\\n\\nThe thing about agnosticism is that there is a difference between believing something and knowing something. For example, I believe climate change is occuring. I have some reasons for this as far as I find it unlikely that all our pollution has no effect on the environment and the weather has been going nuts for at least a decade. But, I don\\'t know for sure. I am too ignorant about the scientific data to know if what they\\'re saying is correct or not. If I devoted a lot of time to it then I could know better but since it doesn\\'t bother me much, I really don\\'t care.\\n\\nHowever, this is a bad example because if religions are true and/or Gods exist then this should be the most important thing to know about. It\\'s not as trivial as climate change.\\n\\nI separate belief and knowledge. To me, knowledge is verified belief - that not only do others believe it but you can prove it. Belief is unproven knowledge. It might be true to you but that\\'s not knowledge, it\\'s a personal opinion.\\n\\n&gt; If one has justifications for believing something, and that belief just so happens to be true, that person has knowledge.\\n\\nThe key phrase is: that belief just so happens to be true. Without it, it\\'s a belief. All belief in any Gods is not knowledge because it fails the \"just so happens to be true\" part.\\n\\nMind you, I might disagree with your definitions. After all, it\\'s my belief - not knowledge - that philosophy has proven exactly nothing in its entire length of existence.\\n\\n&gt; You only believe something because you think it is true.\\n\\nSure... it just doesn\\'t make it true.', \"So what do you think a minister of climate change should be doing exactly?  What roles will he/she be doing and how much time and money is needed to perform these tasks?  If you are so sure that there needs to be one, you surely have a list of duties to be performed that can't possibly be covered by the new set-up.\\n\\nTransparency?  What is the problem here?  You have a list of ministers and a list of their responsibilities.  Can't get more transparent than that.

He had attended an event with the Peaceful Streets Project that night, during which people filmed police officers to increase accountability, and he said that was the main reason he pulled into a parking lot across from the police car.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; What followed was an interaction Johnston describes as uneventful — a brief conversation with two Round Rock officers before he drove away. The police report filed after the incident says that the officers were dealing with an intoxicated man, and that Johnston told them he had pulled over the make a phone call. The report mentions that Johnston was wearing a Peaceful Streets Project T-shirt and wristband, would only roll down the windows part way and filmed the interaction on his cellphone.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; It wasn’t until May 2019, when Johnston called the police after his vehicle was rear ended, that an officer told him that the Round Rock Police Department had an alert on his name, labeling him as \"not police friendly.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Johnston said he does not have any other criminal record and has never been arrested.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; The department like many across the country, including Austin’s uses alert systems to share information among officers.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Police say such alerts make both officers and the public safer by providing officers with necessary information. However, national experts acknowledge that such systems could influence officers, and statewide law enforcement advocates say alerts should only be applied when someone’s behavior puts officers or the public at risk.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Round Rock’s system has flags for people with mental illness, communicable diseases or a history of violent interactions with law enforcement, among others, Police Chief Allen Banks said.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Critics say that because officers can apply alerts without oversight, the alerts could be inconsistent and might cause unnecessary tension when officers interact with those individuals.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Amid the recent protests against police brutality, Johnston said he decided to raise his concerns at a Round Rock City Council meeting in early July.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"Given the climate in the country now, trying to make even a slight change in police policies that I don’t agree with seems like the right thing to do,\" he said in an interview with the Statesman.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Johnston told council members that he wondered what a police officer would think of his own profile: a veteran who at one point had a license to carry a handgun and was labeled as \"not police friendly.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"Police officers are human, they’re fallible and, if they feel like the person they are talking to is not friendly in a way that is antagonistic, I don’t believe that situations are going to be less likely to be escalated,\" he said. \"I think there’s a higher potential for a bad outcome.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Banks disagrees with Johnston’s assessment. He said the alerts are an important tool and are matter of public and officer safety.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"It doesn’t escalate a situation. What it does is allows an officer to prepare for any engagement or interaction,\" he said. \"We have this set up as a safeguard in our community.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Alerts can be placed on a person or address at the discretion of an officer and can be removed later if another officer feels the alert no longer applies, Banks said. An alert might be removed if someone who has been deemed \"not police friendly\" has a subsequent positive interaction with officers or if the department finds a flagged address has new occupants.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Banks said it is hard to quantify how many alerts exist in their system at any given time.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; The Round Rock department has no plans to change the system. He said that since Johnston raised the issue to the City Council, the department has had several positive interactions with him and his alert was removed.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; While the Round Rock Police Department does not share its alerts with other law enforcement agencies, other departments use similar systems.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Austin police Lt. Kenneth Murphy, who manages the Emergency Communications Division, said his department uses caution notes for addresses that are created through a computer-aided dispatch system.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Officers often receive information about caution notes — such as warnings that someone is anti-police, known to have weapons or has a dangerous dog — from dispatchers while responding to a call, Murphy said.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Brandon Gilstrap, the department’s central records manager, said there are many person-based alerts, including anti-police, career criminal, dangerous, mentally unstable, and gang member, as well as alerts for people who are known to use narcotics or carry weapons.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Murphy said the notes help officers handle encounters effectively, such as employing de-escalation techniques or bringing an officer with special mental health training.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"Force escalates when officers are caught off guard,\" he said. \"If officers are prepared, then they’re more likely not to have issues and it’s safer for the citizens.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Gilstrap said the Austin Police Department shares its alerts with certain agencies and offices, such as the fire marshal and district attorney.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Jennifer Szimanski, the public affairs coordinator for the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, said most large law enforcement agencies in Texas use an alert system. However, she said those alerts should be used for concrete public safety concerns and that her organization would not support agencies using designations like \"not police friendly\" if they are not based on an interaction such as an assault on an officer.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"It’s not supposed to be used for any type of opinion,\" Szimanski said. \"If you interact with someone who isn’t friendly with you or was maybe annoyed or pissed off that you were there, it wouldn’t be something that you would put in the notes. It would have to be something that occurred with that person or that resident that would affect public safety and officer safety.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Szimanski said it can be difficult to know from the outside how an officer or department is using any given alert since the language involved is not standardized. In her experience, departments often use the \"anti-police\" and the \"violent against police\" alerts interchangeably. She said that her organization would support the standardization of alerts for clarity, as long as officers are still able to access information about prior incidents before responding to a call.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Maria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said the alerts are an effective way for officers and departments to identify environments and individuals that are responsible for criminal activity or threats against the community.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; However, the system can cause officers to arrive with preconceived notions of what they will find, she said.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"If somebody’s known for having a violent interaction with the police before, they will arrive preparing for the worst. And when you arrive preparing for the worst, you arrive with a heightened state of stress and anxiety,\" she said. \"This might precipitate the use of force.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; There is no way to completely eradicate this negative effect, Haberfeld said.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"The way we process knowledge is directly related to our emotional maturity, emotional intelligence and social intelligence, and unfortunately we don’t necessarily recruit people based on this standard,\" she said. \"I am afraid we are not going to be able to anymore, given the current anti-police sentiment.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Overall, Haberfeld said she believes the alerts are a necessary part of police work.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"There is no way that police officers can just turn off the switch related to prior knowledge. It would be dangerous for them and dangerous for the public,\" she said. \"The alerts are something that’s in the interest of the public, but there’s always this underlying query of: safe at what price? It’s for everyone to answer individually. It’s certainly not designed to oppress or profile anybody.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; With these alert systems in place, Johnston said he wants other people to know they exist. He said that if he was not a \"fairly non-threatening\" white man, police might not have volunteered information about the alert system to him in the first place.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"I do think it’s important for average citizens to understand that these systems are out there,\" he said.', \"&gt; Based on the history of France, who converted half their grid to nuclear in just 15 years, and the recent history of Germany, who has spent comparable time and money on renewables while getting almost nowhere, we can do much faster with nuclear.

This is why renewable sources are so much more popular.  To say nothing of not having to deal with the stigma of being nuclear.

The general response to this would be that there isn't a 1:1 correlation with CO2 in the atmosphere and temperature. The climate is a complex system and solar forcings and other variable all contribute. The reason we've been able to isolate human-caused GHG's as a main driver today, is that we understand the other variables well enough to show that they can't be responsible for all of the warming we're seeing.\\n\\n&gt;C02 is a very important for life on Earth obviously but times when there was more in our atmosphere everything was fine.\\n\\nOf course, which is why all scientists say that it's not the raw number of CO2 in the atmosphere that matters but the rate of change.

As you noted, CO2 can have the effect of increasing the biomass of plants... however, this increase in many plants has meant a lower nutrient to biomass ratio... essentially the plant grows bigger faster but has less protein. Certain insects have evolved to regulate their food intake based on biomass, not amount of protein. So they will eat what they have evolved perceive as adequate amounts of food but the lack of nutrients will leave them more vulnerable during the winter and to disease. A similar phenomenon is happening with nutrients in food grown for humans. So it's not as simple as saying CO2 is essential for life, therefore any rate of change in atmospheric CO2 is good. I don't know why we wouldn't expect to see problems when we're essentially conducting a science experiment on the earth by releasing massive amounts of carbon that had been stored underground. There's no free lunch on earth... there will be costs for such cheap sources of energy.\", \"It's different when you can individually have an effect on it. Obviously it's somewhat of a waste of energy to worry about things you can't do anything about, but climate change is not one of those things.\", \"&gt;No one is going to care how cheap your energy was when climate change has killed you and everyone on earth.\\n\\nThat's why we urgently need to decarbonise. The current halfway house we are heading for, a mix of wind/solar and natural gas, is completely insufficient.\\n\\nThe Energy Research Partnership has calculated that wind power can reduce UK emissions to 180 grams of CO2 per KWH. That's far beyond the target we need to meet. They also calculate we can reach 50 grams with an expansion of nuclear power.\\n\\nHave a look at: https://www.electricitymap.org/?wind=false&amp;solar=false&amp;page=country&amp;remote=true&amp;countryCode=FR\\n\\nWind speeds are quite high at the moment. Germany and Denmark, despite the vast amounts of wind power they have installed, are still emitting very large amounts of CO2. Areas that are meeting the emissions targets use either hydro or nuclear, or a combination of both.\\n\\nSadly the debate in the west has been hijacked by renewables advocates who come up with ridiculous ideas like turning renewable electricity into hydrogen to replace gas, even though it's far too expensive to be practical. Germany has spent hundreds of billions on renewables, but they haven't replaced their coal and gas plants, because intermittent wind and solar require firm backup. We need to face reality on the environment. We need to cut carbon emissions, but using wind and solar, which only work some of the time, isn't going to be enough. \", \"Becuase slavery and modern working conditions are SO similar? \\n\\nClimate change is a major concern to most people I agree  but the drastic change required to fight climate change takes time.

Put the socks with your work clothes, and the shoes in the 5 gallon ziploc. Wear a different pair of shoes the next day and let the first pair bake in the sun outside your house, it should get hot enough inside the bag to kill any fleas and eggs if it has prolonged direct sunlight. Then alternate with your other pair of shoes. If in a colder climate, get a cooler and freeze that shit to produce the same effect.\\n3. Try and remove as much fabric from your room as possible, rugs, unlaminated wall hangings, etc. ask if they can remove any carpets from your room, or give you one of the clear chairmat things that cover them temporarily. \\n4. If you have any pets, make sure they have a flea collar. Frontline is bullshit (ok, its not, but its nowhere near as good as an actual collar) and change it every month or so. \\n5.

Trying to pretend that the weather pattern isn't in any way effected by the climate is like saying your high blood pressure isn't about what you eat or how much you exercise.   Now to extend that metaphor, the time to discuss diet and exercise isn't after you've had a heart attack so in that respect, talking about climate change now is a bit day late dollar short.

Of course the frequency of these storms and the absolute deluge of these rain events (Baton Rouge last year, Meyer land last year etc) are results at least in part of climate change.

He had attended an event with the Peaceful Streets Project that night, during which people filmed police officers to increase accountability, and he said that was the main reason he pulled into a parking lot across from the police car.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; What followed was an interaction Johnston describes as uneventful — a brief conversation with two Round Rock officers before he drove away. The police report filed after the incident says that the officers were dealing with an intoxicated man, and that Johnston told them he had pulled over the make a phone call. The report mentions that Johnston was wearing a Peaceful Streets Project T-shirt and wristband, would only roll down the windows part way and filmed the interaction on his cellphone.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; It wasn’t until May 2019, when Johnston called the police after his vehicle was rear ended, that an officer told him that the Round Rock Police Department had an alert on his name, labeling him as \"not police friendly.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Johnston said he does not have any other criminal record and has never been arrested.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; The department like many across the country, including Austin’s uses alert systems to share information among officers.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Police say such alerts make both officers and the public safer by providing officers with necessary information. However, national experts acknowledge that such systems could influence officers, and statewide law enforcement advocates say alerts should only be applied when someone’s behavior puts officers or the public at risk.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Round Rock’s system has flags for people with mental illness, communicable diseases or a history of violent interactions with law enforcement, among others, Police Chief Allen Banks said.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Critics say that because officers can apply alerts without oversight, the alerts could be inconsistent and might cause unnecessary tension when officers interact with those individuals.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Amid the recent protests against police brutality, Johnston said he decided to raise his concerns at a Round Rock City Council meeting in early July.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"Given the climate in the country now, trying to make even a slight change in police policies that I don’t agree with seems like the right thing to do,\" he said in an interview with the Statesman.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Johnston told council members that he wondered what a police officer would think of his own profile: a veteran who at one point had a license to carry a handgun and was labeled as \"not police friendly.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"Police officers are human, they’re fallible and, if they feel like the person they are talking to is not friendly in a way that is antagonistic, I don’t believe that situations are going to be less likely to be escalated,\" he said. \"I think there’s a higher potential for a bad outcome.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Banks disagrees with Johnston’s assessment. He said the alerts are an important tool and are matter of public and officer safety.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"It doesn’t escalate a situation. What it does is allows an officer to prepare for any engagement or interaction,\" he said. \"We have this set up as a safeguard in our community.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Alerts can be placed on a person or address at the discretion of an officer and can be removed later if another officer feels the alert no longer applies, Banks said. An alert might be removed if someone who has been deemed \"not police friendly\" has a subsequent positive interaction with officers or if the department finds a flagged address has new occupants.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Banks said it is hard to quantify how many alerts exist in their system at any given time.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; The Round Rock department has no plans to change the system. He said that since Johnston raised the issue to the City Council, the department has had several positive interactions with him and his alert was removed.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; While the Round Rock Police Department does not share its alerts with other law enforcement agencies, other departments use similar systems.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Austin police Lt. Kenneth Murphy, who manages the Emergency Communications Division, said his department uses caution notes for addresses that are created through a computer-aided dispatch system.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Officers often receive information about caution notes — such as warnings that someone is anti-police, known to have weapons or has a dangerous dog — from dispatchers while responding to a call, Murphy said.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Brandon Gilstrap, the department’s central records manager, said there are many person-based alerts, including anti-police, career criminal, dangerous, mentally unstable, and gang member, as well as alerts for people who are known to use narcotics or carry weapons.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Murphy said the notes help officers handle encounters effectively, such as employing de-escalation techniques or bringing an officer with special mental health training.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"Force escalates when officers are caught off guard,\" he said. \"If officers are prepared, then they’re more likely not to have issues and it’s safer for the citizens.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Gilstrap said the Austin Police Department shares its alerts with certain agencies and offices, such as the fire marshal and district attorney.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Jennifer Szimanski, the public affairs coordinator for the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, said most large law enforcement agencies in Texas use an alert system. However, she said those alerts should be used for concrete public safety concerns and that her organization would not support agencies using designations like \"not police friendly\" if they are not based on an interaction such as an assault on an officer.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"It’s not supposed to be used for any type of opinion,\" Szimanski said. \"If you interact with someone who isn’t friendly with you or was maybe annoyed or pissed off that you were there, it wouldn’t be something that you would put in the notes. It would have to be something that occurred with that person or that resident that would affect public safety and officer safety.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Szimanski said it can be difficult to know from the outside how an officer or department is using any given alert since the language involved is not standardized. In her experience, departments often use the \"anti-police\" and the \"violent against police\" alerts interchangeably. She said that her organization would support the standardization of alerts for clarity, as long as officers are still able to access information about prior incidents before responding to a call.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Maria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, said the alerts are an effective way for officers and departments to identify environments and individuals that are responsible for criminal activity or threats against the community.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; However, the system can cause officers to arrive with preconceived notions of what they will find, she said.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"If somebody’s known for having a violent interaction with the police before, they will arrive preparing for the worst. And when you arrive preparing for the worst, you arrive with a heightened state of stress and anxiety,\" she said. \"This might precipitate the use of force.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; There is no way to completely eradicate this negative effect, Haberfeld said.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"The way we process knowledge is directly related to our emotional maturity, emotional intelligence and social intelligence, and unfortunately we don’t necessarily recruit people based on this standard,\" she said. \"I am afraid we are not going to be able to anymore, given the current anti-police sentiment.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; Overall, Haberfeld said she believes the alerts are a necessary part of police work.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"There is no way that police officers can just turn off the switch related to prior knowledge. It would be dangerous for them and dangerous for the public,\" she said. \"The alerts are something that’s in the interest of the public, but there’s always this underlying query of: safe at what price? It’s for everyone to answer individually. It’s certainly not designed to oppress or profile anybody.\"\\n&gt; \\n&gt; With these alert systems in place, Johnston said he wants other people to know they exist. He said that if he was not a \"fairly non-threatening\" white man, police might not have volunteered information about the alert system to him in the first place.\\n&gt; \\n&gt; \"I do think it’s important for average citizens to understand that these systems are out there,\" he said.', \"&gt; Based on the history of France, who converted half their grid to nuclear in just 15 years, and the recent history of Germany, who has spent comparable time and money on renewables while getting almost nowhere, we can do much faster with nuclear.

This is why renewable sources are so much more popular.  To say nothing of not having to deal with the stigma of being nuclear.  I mean, the dangers of nuclear reactors are essentially a part of American culture.  And there's no getting away from that.  Nuclear, as a broad-based go-to power source, is dead.

That’s the last thing they want so many just follow along.\\n\\nDo you have any evidence for such a large scale conspiracy? There would have to be massive coordination across the the entire globe to pull off a conspiracy of that magnitude. What you're alleging is different than misaligned incentives. If you think that the entire field of climate science is completely corrupt to the point where they're making all of the science up in regards to CO2 being a primary driver of climate change and humans being responsible for all or most of the warming in the last half a century you would need some pretty strong evidence to corroborate such a claim.\\n\\n&gt;I think it has turn to political and believe it will hurt poorer countries more than developed ones.\\n\\nWhere's your evidence for this?\\n\\n&gt;Ice core samples have shown less cO2 in our atmosphere in the past around the same time Scotland had vineyards and Europe was going through a long warm spell.\\n\\nCan you give me a source for that? Here's an article that gives some thoughts on the 'vineyards in England' argument: [http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/07/medieval-warmth-and-english-wine/](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2006/07/medieval-warmth-and-english-wine/)\\n\\n&gt;Then ice core samples have shown large amounts of C02 in our atmosphere during times of long periods of cold.\\n\\nCan you show me which period in Earth's history you're referring to? The general response to this would be that there isn't a 1:1 correlation with CO2 in the atmosphere and temperature. The climate is a complex system and solar forcings and other variable all contribute. The reason we've been able to isolate human-caused GHG's as a main driver today, is that we understand the other variables well enough to show that they can't be responsible for all of the warming we're seeing.\\n\\n&gt;C02 is a very important for life on Earth obviously but times when there was more in our atmosphere everything was fine.\\n\\nOf course, which is why all scientists say that it's not the raw number of CO2 in the atmosphere that matters but the rate of change. Current lifeforms, including humans, have evolved to thrive in certain climate conditions... for instance, there are many studies being done on how climate change is impacting insects. As you noted, CO2 can have the effect of increasing the biomass of plants... however, this increase in many plants has meant a lower nutrient to biomass ratio... essentially the plant grows bigger faster but has less protein. Certain insects have evolved to regulate their food intake based on biomass, not amount of protein. So they will eat what they have evolved perceive as adequate amounts of food but the lack of nutrients will leave them more vulnerable during the winter and to disease. A similar phenomenon is happening with nutrients in food grown for humans. So it's not as simple as saying CO2 is essential for life, therefore any rate of change in atmospheric CO2 is good. I don't know why we wouldn't expect to see problems when we're essentially conducting a science experiment on the earth by releasing massive amounts of carbon that had been stored underground. There's no free lunch on earth... there will be costs for such cheap sources of energy.\", \"It's different when you can individually have an effect on it. Obviously it's somewhat of a waste of energy to worry about things you can't do anything about, but climate change is not one of those things.\", \"&gt;No one is going to care how cheap your energy was when climate change has killed you and everyone on earth.\\n\\nThat's why we urgently need to decarbonise. The current halfway house we are heading for, a mix of wind/solar and natural gas, is completely insufficient.\\n\\nThe Energy Research Partnership has calculated that wind power can reduce UK emissions to 180 grams of CO2 per KWH. That's far beyond the target we need to meet. They also calculate we can reach 50 grams with an expansion of nuclear power.\\n\\nHave a look at: https://www.electricitymap.org/?wind=false&amp;solar=false&amp;page=country&amp;remote=true&amp;countryCode=FR\\n\\nWind speeds are quite high at the moment. Germany and Denmark, despite the vast amounts of wind power they have installed, are still emitting very large amounts of CO2. Areas that are meeting the emissions targets use either hydro or nuclear, or a combination of both.\\n\\nSadly the debate in the west has been hijacked by renewables advocates who come up with ridiculous ideas like turning renewable electricity into hydrogen to replace gas, even though it's far too expensive to be practical. Germany has spent hundreds of billions on renewables, but they haven't replaced their coal and gas plants, because intermittent wind and solar require firm backup. We need to face reality on the environment. We need to cut carbon emissions, but using wind and solar, which only work some of the time, isn't going to be enough. \", \"Becuase slavery and modern working conditions are SO similar? \\n\\nClimate change is a major concern to most people I agree  but the drastic change required to fight climate change takes time.

Harries, Imperial College\\n\\n&gt;Previously published work using satellite observations of the clear sky infrared emitted radiation by the Earth in 1970, 1997 and in 2003 showed the appearance of changes in the outgoing spectrum, which agreed with those expected from known changes in the concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases over this period.

Results from current climate models indicate that water vapor increases of this magnitude cannot be explained by climate noise alone. In a formal detection and attribution analysis using the pooled results from 22 different climate models, the simulated “fingerprint” pattern of anthropogenically caused changes in water vapor is identifiable with high statistical confidence in the SSM/I data. Experiments in which forcing factors are varied individually suggest that this fingerprint “match” is primarily due to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases and not to solar forcing or recovery from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of an emerging anthropogenic signal in the moisture content of earth's atmosphere.\\n\\nIdentification of human-induced changes in atmospheric moisture content, B.

Implications include: (i) expectation of additional global warming of about 0.6°C without further change of atmospheric composition; (ii) confirmation of the climate system’s lag in responding to forcings, implying the need for anticipatory actions to avoid any specified level of climate change; and (iii) likelihood of acceleration of ice sheet disintegration and sea level rise.\\n\\nEarth’s Energy Imbalance: Confirmation and Implications, James Hansen, Larissa Nazarenko, Reto Ruedy, Makiko Sato, Josh Willis, Anthony Del Genio, Dorothy Koch, Andrew Lacis, Ken Lo, Surabi Menon, Tica Novakov, Judith Perlwitz, Gary Russell, Gavin A.

Harries, Imperial College\\n\\n&gt;Previously published work using satellite observations of the clear sky infrared emitted radiation by the Earth in 1970, 1997 and in 2003 showed the appearance of changes in the outgoing spectrum, which agreed with those expected from known changes in the concentrations of well-mixed greenhouse gases over this period. Thus, the greenhouse forcing of the Earth has been observed to change in response to these concentration changes.\\n\\nSpectral signatures of climate change in the Earth’s infrared spectrum between 1970 and 2006, Claudine Chen, John Harries, Helen Brindley, Mark Ringer, Imperial College\\n\\nSpecial Sensor Microwave Imager results and analysis:\\n\\n&gt;Data from the satellite-based Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) show that the total atmospheric moisture content over oceans has increased by 0.41 kg/m2 per decade since 1988. Results from current climate models indicate that water vapor increases of this magnitude cannot be explained by climate noise alone. In a formal detection and attribution analysis using the pooled results from 22 different climate models, the simulated “fingerprint” pattern of anthropogenically caused changes in water vapor is identifiable with high statistical confidence in the SSM/I data. Experiments in which forcing factors are varied individually suggest that this fingerprint “match” is primarily due to human-caused increases in greenhouse gases and not to solar forcing or recovery from the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. Our findings provide preliminary evidence of an emerging anthropogenic signal in the moisture content of earth's atmosphere.\\n\\nIdentification of human-induced changes in atmospheric moisture content, B.
