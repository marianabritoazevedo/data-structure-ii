## :mag: About this project

This project aims to carry out an adaptation of the guided project __"Building Fast Queries on a CSV"__ from the course Algorithms Complexity, made by Dataquest.io. Thus, using the dataset __"The Reddit Climate Change Dataset"__, 3 functions were created with two different implementations, in order to compare the performance of each one of them. Those 3 main functions are:

1. Given an id of a message on Reddit, return all information about the message;
2. Given a lower and upper bound of the "sentiment" column, return all messages with sentiment values between the lower and upper bounds;
3. Given a parameter value, return two messages whose sum of the value of the "score" column is equal to the parameter. Return -1 if it doesn't exist.
