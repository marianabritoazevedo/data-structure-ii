## :grey_question:The problem 

The objective of this project was to analyze datasets from Google Play Store and Apple Store, in order to understand which types of applications are most attractive to users. It was a guided project included in dataquest.io formation in the course *Python for Data Engineering: Fundamentals Part II*, addaptaded to include OOP concepts studied in the discipline of data structure II

## :mag:About the dataset

Both datasets contain key information related to an app, such as the app's name, price, genre, size, rating, and more

## :bulb:Step by step of the project
- Using the concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP), a class called Dataset was created to store the data in a list of lists, and several methods were created to perform all the necessary analysis of the data.
- After that, was made the data cleaning process, in which incorrect lines were removed, duplicate lines were deleted and only information from apps whose name was in English and that they were free were kept.
- Finally, after cleaning the data, several analyzes were performed on some columns of the dataset, such as the number of applications of a certain genre or category. For this, frequency tables were created using Python dictionaries.
