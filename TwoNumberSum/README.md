## :grey_question:Problem: Two Number Sum

This algorithm aims to solve the following problem: given an array of integers and an integer value called `targetsum`, we want to check if there are two values in this array of numbers that, when added, result in the `targetsum`.

## :bulb:Solutions

For this, two solutions were implemented:
- `TwoNumberSum`: with O(nÂ²) complexity, where two repetition structures are implemented
- `TwoNumberSum2`: with O(n) complexity, in which only one repetition structure is used, and a python data structure called dictionary is also handled
