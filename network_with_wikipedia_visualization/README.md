# FIFA World Cup 2022 - Network Visualization

This project aims to visualize a network built from Wikipedia page links. The construction and analysis of this network, using the `FIFA 2022 World Cup` wikipedia page as the initial node, has already been carried out previously, and can be seen at [this link](https://github.com/marianabritoazevedo/data-structure-ii/tree/main/network_with_wikipedia).

For the production of interactive network visualizations, the tools used were: [Gephi](https://gephi.org/), with the `SigmaExporter` plugin, [Retina](https://ouestware.gitlab.io/retina/beta/), a plugin of Gephi tool and [Gephisto](https://jacomyma.github.io/gephisto/). The productions of these tools will be explored separately for each tool.

It is worth mentioning that this work was done in a group, developed by [Mariana Azevedo](https://github.com/marianabritoazevedo), [Morsinaldo Medeiros](https://github.com/Morsinaldo) and [Tha√≠s Medeiros](https://github.com/thaisaraujo2000).
