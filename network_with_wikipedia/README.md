## Building a network with wikipedia

This project aims to build a network from wikipedia page links, and perform many analyses in this network. For this, the `2022 FIFA World Cup` wikipedia page was used as the initial node of the network. For this, some python libraries were used to help in this construction, such as the `networkx` and `wikipedia` libraries.

In this way, the network from wikipedia links, starting with `2022 FIFA World Cup` was created and pre-processed, and then, it was analyzed the degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centraility for this network; it was visualized the core and the shell; and finally, it was created a data pipeline for this network, including the steps of collecting data, cleaning data, and export the results of the final artifact.

It is important to highlight that this work was carried out in a group. This work was done by me, [Mariana Azevedo](https://github.com/marianabritoazevedo) [![Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Repo-191A1B?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/marianabritoazevedo/embedded-ai/tree/main/LeNet-IvaNet),  [Morsinaldo Medeiros](https://github.com/Morsinaldo) [![Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Repo-191A1B?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/Morsinaldo/embedded_artificial_intelligence/tree/main/projects/lenet5) and [Tha√≠s Medeiros](https://github.com/thaisaraujo2000?tab=repositories) [![Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Repo-191A1B?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/thaisaraujo2000/embedded_artificial_intelligence/tree/main/projects/project_2)

### Pre-processing the network

The image below shows the process of cleaning data for the creation of this network. Initially, after collecting all the links with only one layer deep, there were 78588 nodes and 212551 edges. Then, two steps of pre-processing were made: eliminate duplicated nodes and eliminate nodes with degree = 1. After these steps, the final network had 27055 nodes and 161018 edges.

### Exploring the network

#### Most significant nodes

To visualize the most significant nodes of this network, it was calculated the `indegree` of each degree, which is, the number of connections entering the node, since this is a network directed.

The image below shows the top 10 of these most significant nodes, but it's possible to conclude that most of these nodes refer to past World Cup editions, to soccer-related terms, or even to some prominent teams, including the Brazilian team.

#### Degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centrality

Before checking the results, it is important to understand what these concepts mean:

*  __Degree centrality__: checks the number of connections (neighbors) of a node according to the number of nodes in the network;
*  __Closeness centrality__: checks the average distance of a node to all other nodes. Thus, if the value of this metric is small for a certain node, it means that this node is farther from all other nodes in the network.
*  __Betweenness centrality__: checks the position of a node on the shortest path. That is, if I am analyzing `node i`, among all the shortest paths from `node j` to `node h`, how many of these paths does `node i` form part of?
*  __Eigenvector centrality__: checks the importance of a node based on the importance of its neighbors, that is, it checks whether a given node has important neighbors.
